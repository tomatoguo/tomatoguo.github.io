### ListView缓存机制

#### RecycleBin

ListView类继承自AbsListView类，RecycleBin为AbsListView的内部类，用于复用布局中的视图。下面对RecycleBin的一些字段和方法进行说明。

	/**
	* Views that were on screen at the start of layout. This array is populated at the start of
	* layout, and at the end of layout all view in mActiveViews are moved to mScrapViews.
	* Views in mActiveViews represent a contiguous range of Views, with position of the first
	* view store in mFirstActivePosition.
